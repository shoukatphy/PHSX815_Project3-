# PHSX815_Project3
This project contains two independent programs. The first program **``getDecay.C``** is simulating the data based on the true value of a param
eter. This parameter spacifies the probabilities for the outcomes in a single trial. We put the true value for the parameter as **0.44**, which is also the probability of detecting beta particle in the detector in a single decay. 
\(E=mc^2\)
