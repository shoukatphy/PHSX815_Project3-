# PHSX815_Project3
This project contains two independent programs. The first program **``getDecay.C``** is simulating the data based on the true value of a param
eter. This parameter spacifies the probabilities for the outcomes in a single trial. We put the true value for the parameter as **0.44**, which is also the probability of detecting beta particle in the detector in a single decay. ðŸ‘Ž
The second program analyse the data and estimates a value for the unknown paramter. What it usuallyd do is, it writes an expression for the log-likelihood ratio(LLR) for the the probability distribution ([categorical distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_distribution))
